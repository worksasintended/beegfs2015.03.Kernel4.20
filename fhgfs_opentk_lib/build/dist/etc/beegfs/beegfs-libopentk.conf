# This file is used by /usr/sbin/beegfs-setup-rdma.

# The option FORCE_IB forcefully enables Infiniband RDMA support for the BeeGFS
# userspace opentk library.
# This is useful for systems where nodes provisioning images are created in a
# chroot: If the server of that chroot does not have IB support or the chroot
# does not have all required file systems mounted, then native IB support would
# be disabled during the beegfs-opentk-lib package installation.
#
# Setting FORCE_IB=1 here will skip auto-detection and always enable IB support.

FORCE_IB=0
