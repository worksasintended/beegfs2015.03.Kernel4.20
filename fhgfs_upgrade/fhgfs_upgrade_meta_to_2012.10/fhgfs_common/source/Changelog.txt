== Changes in 2012.XX-r1 ==

=== Client ===
* new: support for vanilla kernels up to version 3.2 (min version: 2.6.16)
* new: optional syslog logging instead of helperd logging
* new: procfs entry for log level changes at runtime
* improved: redesigned/improved page cache mode.
* improved: always use intents for lookups

=== Metadata Server ===
* new: more efficient data storage format (merges dentries and inodes)

=== Storage Server ===
* new: storage benchmark mode to test storage targets throughput independent
     of network communication (started via fhgfs-ctl --storagebench)

=== Admon (Installation & Monitoring) ===
* improved: lots of minor changes and improvements

=== Online Configuration Tool ===
* improved: parameters now specified in more commonly known "--param" syntax

=== File System Consistency Check ===

=== Misc ===
* new: network test mode with disabled disk IO on storage servers (can be
     enabled per client via procfs entry "netbench_mode")

=== Compatibility ===
* note: This release can read the storage format of the previous 2011.04 release
  series and can convert it to a new format, without the need to use separate
  upgrade tools. However, the network protocol is not compatible with the 
  previous 2011.04 release series, so clients and servers of different release
  series cannot be mixed together in the same file system instance.

      line argument.)


== Changes in 2011.04-r1 ==

This is a major update with new features and improvements in all areas.

Some of the key features are:

* Storage servers support multiple storage targets per server
* Metadata servers can store metadata as extended attributes
* Detailed per-client statistics
* Simplified installation/updates via software repositories (yum, apt)
* Support for distributed POSIX locking
* Enhanced graphical administration interface


Full List of Changes:

=== General ===
* new: option to use global POSIX file range and entry locks (can be activated
     via new client option tuneUseGlobalFileLocks)
* new: servers can be configured to refuse startup with uninitialized storage
     directory (e.g. if local file system not mounted correctly)
* improved: added new flow control algorithm to Infiniband connections (helps
     to keep throughput high even if file chunk sizes are larger than network
     buffers)
* improved: new layout of config files (separated options and documentation
     to give a better overview of available settings)
* improved: FhGFS OpenTk userspace communication library comes pre-build with
     and without native Infiniband support (update via 
     /usr/sbin/fhgfs-opentk-lib-update-ib)

=== Client ===
* new: support for kernels up to vanilla version 2.6.38 (min version: 2.6.16)
* new: client module build process is now integrated into client init script
     (i.e. no more separate "make" required); set build arguments via 
     /etc/fhgfs/fhgfs-client-autobuild.conf
* new: directory entry type hints (to allow more efficient exectuion of e.g.
     "ls" and "find")
* new: client-side idle disconnect of unused connections (to avoid ambiguous
     network log warnings from former server-side idle disconnects) 
* new: optional mount sanity check to refuse mounting in case of detected
     problems
* new: support for special files (e.g. FIFOs)
* improved: adaptive read-ahead (detection of random access)
* improved: more info in "/proc/fs/fhgfs" (e.g. connected IPs)
* improved: redesigned automatic rebuild of client kernel modules in case of
     kernel version changes (does not require DKMS)

=== Management Server ===
* new: free space pools for storage and metadata servers to keep server usage
    balanced (configure in fhgfs-mgmtd.conf, query with fhgfs-ctl tool)
* new: config file option to reject registration of new servers

=== Metadata Server ===
* new: option to store metadata as extended attributes (enabled by default in
    config file); reduces disk seeks if ext3/4 inode size is at least 512 bytes
* new: optional round-robin storage targets chooser (currently most useful to
    have deterministic/reproducible striping during initial system tuning)
* improved: extended storage format saves all file attributes, including size
    and mtime (less communication with storage servers required)
* improved: redesign of internal request handling structure to improve
    behaviour in high concurrency situations
* improved: memory management

=== Storage Server ===
* new: support for multiple storage targets per server
* new: Direct IO flag (O_DIRECT) from client apps is now passed through to
    storage servers
* improved: added some new tuning options to config file (e.g. read/write IO 
    sizes)

=== Admon (Installation & Monitoring) ===
* new: can now also show metadata server statistics
* new: can now retrieve server log files
* new: Java GUI can be downloaded by pointing a webbrowser to the admon daemon
    (typically http://<admon_host>:8000)
* improved: redesigned GUI based on faster drawing library and new internal
    http server
* improved: installation based on new yum/zypper/apt repositories

=== Online Configuration Tool ===
* new: mode for detailed per-client operation statistics
* new: reachability (liveness) check for servers and clients
* new: wrapper scripts ("/usr/bin/fhgfs-check-servers" & co) to make usage more
     convenient
* new: can read multiple paths from stdin for some modes (e.g. mode 
     "getentryinfo")
* new: mount path detection (no more relative path arguments required)
* improved: help layout
* improved: shorter command name "/usr/bin/fhgfs-ctl"

=== File System Consistency Check ===
* new: parallel online file system check and repair tool (fhgfs-fsck)
     (not included in initial release)

=== Compatibility ===
* note: This release series introduces a new storage format, which is
     incompatible with previous versions. We strongly recommend to backup your
     data before upgrading. We will also provide a tool to convert existing
     data to the new version.
