/*
 * Personal queues are intended to assign work directly to a specific worker thread.
 *
 * This is useful when we need to make sure that each worker gets a certain work request at least
 * once, e.g. to synchronize workers for fsck modification logging.
 *
 * This class has no own mutex for thread-safety, it is sync'ed via the MultiWorkQueue mutex.
 * So adding work to it is done via MultiWorkQueue methods.
 *
 * Note: Workers always prefer requests in the personal queue over requests in the other queues,
 * so keep possible starvation of requests in other queues in mind when you use personal queues.
