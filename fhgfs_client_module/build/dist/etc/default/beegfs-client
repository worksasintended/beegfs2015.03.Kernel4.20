# BeeGFS client service configuration.

# Set to "NO" to disable start of the BeeGFS client via the init script.
START_SERVICE="YES"

# Set to "YES" if you want to start multiple clients with different
# configuration files on this machine.
#
# Create a subdirectory with the ending ".d" in "/etc/beegfs/" for every config
# file. The subdirectory name will be used to identify a particular client
# instance for init script start/stop.
#
# Note: The original config file in /etc/beegfs will not be used when multi-mode
# is enabled.
#
# Example: /etc/beegfs/scratch.d/beegfs-client.conf
# $ /etc/init.d/beegfs-client start scratch
